I. Introduction and Core Purpose
This is the Simple Python Task Manager, a command-line interface application written in Python. This
tool was created to provide users with an easy and highly approachable manner of managing day-today tasks without the use of any external databases or heavy graphical interfaces. This example
serves as a simple real-world example in Python, teaching how to manipulate lists, use functions, and
interact with user console input/output.
A. Core Purpose and Objectives:-
The core purpose of the Simple Python Task Manager is to provide an efficient, minimalist tool for
personal productivity.
The main objectives are:
B. Task Organization and Prioritization
The application endeavors to manage tasks by listing all items in a clear, numbered fashion. A key
feature of the application includes an automatic sorting mechanism that ensures pending tasks are
always shown at the top of the list so the user can immediately identify what needs to be attended
to next.
C. Tracking Completion Status
The manager enables tracking of task progress through marking tasks as "DONE." This gives
immediate visual feedback on the user's accomplishments by moving completed tasks to the bottom
of the list so that current obligations remain in focus.
D. Ease of Use and Accessibility
The project is designed on the lines of simplicity. It depends only on the standard Python
environment and nothing else, thus making it very lightweight and highly accessible. Having a menudriven, text-based interface, the application is intuitive to navigate for anyone who knows what a
command line is.
